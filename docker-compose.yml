# ======================================
# Docker Compose Configuration
# ======================================
# Defines three services: Keycloak (auth), Kafka (event streaming), and app (main application)
# Environment variables: USER (system user) and APP_SHORTNAME (from .env or shell)
#
# Usage:
#   just up       # Build image and start services
#   just down     # Stop and remove all services
#   docker-compose logs -f app  # View app logs

services:
  # ======================================
  # Keycloak - Authentication & Authorization
  # ======================================
  # OpenID Connect provider for user authentication
  # Runs in development mode with default credentials (admin:admin)
  # Admin console: http://127.0.0.1:8180/admin
  keycloak:
    image: quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:latest
    container_name: keycloak
    command:
      - start-dev
      - --import-realm
    environment:
      # Default admin credentials (development only - change in production!)
      KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME: admin
      KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD: admin
      # Keycloak hostname configuration
      # KC_HOSTNAME: hostname Keycloak advertises in OIDC issuer URLs (discovery, redirects)
      # KC_HOSTNAME_PORT: port for issued URLs (must match published port 8180)
      #
      # Why `localhost:8180`?
      # - Browsers are redirected to the hostname Keycloak advertises.
      # - The Go OIDC client validates the issuer URL strictly.
      # - This repo standardizes on http://localhost:8180 as the issuer.
      KC_HOSTNAME: localhost
      KC_HOSTNAME_PORT: 8180
      KC_HOSTNAME_PROTOCOL: http
      # Disable strict hostname checking (allows browser to reach via localhost:8180)
      KC_HOSTNAME_STRICT: "false"

      # Map to 8180 to avoid conflict with app service on 8080
      - "8180:8080"
    restart: unless-stopped

  # ======================================
  # Kafka - Event Streaming & Message Broker
  # ======================================
  # Distributed event log for domain event persistence
  # Used by event_publisher in internal/adapters/outbound/
  # Auto-creates topics on first use
  kafka:
    image: apache/kafka:latest
    container_name: kafka
    ports:
      # Kafka broker port (localhost only for security)

    restart: unless-stopped

  # ======================================
  # App - Go DDD/Hexagonal Application
  # ======================================
  # Main application container built from Dockerfile
  # Provides HTTP API on port 8080 and CLI tools
  # Depends on Keycloak for auth and Kafka for events
  app:
    image: "${USER}/${APP_SHORTNAME}:latest"
    container_name: "${APP_SHORTNAME}"
    depends_on:
      - keycloak
      - kafka
    env_file:
      # Load all environment variables from .env into the container
      - .env
    volumes:
      # Persist reservation data across container restarts
      - ./reservations.json:/reservations.json
    ports:
      # HTTP server (localhost only - use reverse proxy in production)
      - "8080:8080"
    extra_hosts:
      # Allow the app container to reach host-published services via `localhost`.
      #
      # This is used to keep a single OIDC issuer URL (http://localhost:8180/realms/local)
      # that works for both:
      # - the browser on the host
      # - the app inside the container (which otherwise can't reach host localhost)
      #
      # Requires a Docker engine that supports `host-gateway`.
      - "localhost:host-gateway"
    restart: unless-stopped
